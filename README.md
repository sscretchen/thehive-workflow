# TheHive Workflow

Using TheHive to show multiple workflows with the platform

### Open Tasks

### The Workflow

ðŸ’¡ There are two ways I use with TheHive

1. Manual input for building cases
2. Using established playbooks

### Manual Execution
> An on the fly approach to building cases

The main panel view for the user. I use this area to track any cases assigned or created myself. I will have more information to show as I build out a simulated case.

To get things started, click on `+ New Case` at the top. From here, the details of the case will be outlined. A few key points:

- TLP (Traffic Light Protocol) - This functions as an Access Control for sharing information. Depending on the sensitivity of the incident, you may need restrict who can share incident details.
- PAP (Permissible Actions Protocol) - Indicates how to use IoCs while investigating. This involves taking a passive or active response on the IoC.
- Tags - This is a minor detail but I think it can act as metadata for future analysis. I would just be weary of adding too many tags or this field becomes moot.

### Playbook Execution
> Critical incidents may call for a more thorough approach. This demonstration will use established playbooks and map any identified TTPs to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
